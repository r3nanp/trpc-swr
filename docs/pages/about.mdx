# About

tRPC-SWR is a React library that makes it easy to fetch data from your backend and keep it in sync with your frontend. It's built on top of [SWR](https://swr.vercel.app/) and [tRPC](https://trpc.io/).

It was first created by [Sachin Raja](https://github.com/sachinraja) to add support for `SWR` in the tRPC ecosystem. Once tRPC v10 was released, a new RFC was created by [Sanna Jammeh](https://github.com/sannajammeh) to rewrite the library from scratch to better align with the new tRPC v10 API.
